#  Modules And packages
#  Module is a piece of software that has a specific functionality.
#  Modules in python simply are the files ending with .py extension.
#  for ex- we have two files game.py, draw.py
#  The name of the module will be the name of the file.
#  A module can have a set of functions, variables and classes defined and implemented.
#  The Python script game.py will implement the game. It will use the function draw_game
#  from the file draw.py, or in other words, the draw module,
#  that implements the logic for drawing the game on the screen.
#  Modules are imported from other modules using the import command.
#  below is the sample script-
#  file name -> game.py
import draw  # import the draw module


def play_game():
    return "hi"


def main():
    result = play_game()
    draw.draw_game(result)

# this means that if this script is executed, then
# main() will be executed


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

#  Importing all objects from a module
#  We can use 'import *' to import all objects from a specific module
#  Ex-  import the draw module
from draw import *


def play_game():
    return "hi"


def main():
    result = play_game()
    draw_game(result)

#  Custom import name
#  we can import modules under the name we want.
#  for example-
import draw as drw


def main():
    drw.draw_game()
